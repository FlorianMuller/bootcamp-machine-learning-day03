1 - What is the main difference between univariate and multivariate linear regression, in terms of variables?
It's the number of feature (and the number of thetas)
Because there's more than one feature, x is a Matrix and not a vector


2 - Is there a minimum number of variables needed to perform a multivariate linear regression? If yes, which one?
I suppose we need minimum 2 feature ?
If we only have one it's a univariate linear regression, no ? ðŸ¤”


3 - Is there a maximum number of variables needed to perform a multivariate linear regression? If yes, which
one?
No, we can have as much feature as we want


4 - Is there a difference between univariate and multivariate linear regression in terms of performance evaluation?
multivariate linear regression is more precise in general (but I suppose it also depent on the data)


5 - What does it mean geometrically to perform a multivariate gradient descent with two variables?
to performe a gradient descent in 3 dimension (2 feature + theta0) ?
